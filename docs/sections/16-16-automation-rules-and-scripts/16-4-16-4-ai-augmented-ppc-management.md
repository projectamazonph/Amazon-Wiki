# 16.4 AI-Augmented PPC Management

**What this page teaches:** AI can classify search terms, summarize reports, draft recommendations, and detect anomalies.

**Explain it to a fresh graduate:** AI is a helpful analyst, not the account owner. It can suggest. Humans approve.

**Why this matters in real accounts:** This topic affects money, visibility, campaign control, reporting clarity, or team execution. A beginner should understand the business reason before learning the console clicks.

**What to build into the wiki:** Use human-in-the-loop guardrails, evidence requirements, and rollback plans for AI-assisted changes.

**Operator view:** Use this page to understand the decision the topic supports, the data needed before acting, and the safest first move for a beginner.

**Practical workflow:**
- Read the definition and linked glossary terms.
- Identify what decision this topic affects.
- Find the report, console screen, or input data required.
- Make a small reversible change first when working in a live account.
- Write down what changed and why.

**Worked mini-example:** A junior operator reviews the page, opens the correct report, checks the required metric, makes one controlled change, and records it in the change log.

**Common beginner mistakes:**
- Skipping the context and copying tactics blindly.
- Changing a live account without checking eligibility, budget, or data window.
- Forgetting to log the reason behind the change.

**Definition of done:**
- The learner can explain the topic without jargon.
- The learner can name the report, console area, or data input used for this topic.
- The learner can describe one safe action, one risky action, and one escalation trigger.

## Merged from Complete Data-Filled Guide
## Complete data-filled section notes

Automation helps scale PPC work, but it should not replace judgment. Good automation handles repetitive rules. Humans handle context, margins, inventory, and strategy.

### Native automation

Amazon automated rules can adjust bids or budgets based on conditions. Example rules: increase bid when ACOS is below target and orders are strong; decrease bid when ACOS is too high; raise budget during events.

### Bulk Operations

Bulk files are spreadsheets for large-scale changes. Use them to add keywords, change bids, pause targets, update budgets, and add negatives. Always review upload errors and keep a backup before mass changes.

### API and scripts

The Amazon Ads API can request reports, update campaigns, adjust bids, and manage targets. Build automation for alerts, recurring reports, search-term classification, and controlled bid changes.

### AI-assisted workflows

LLMs can classify search terms, draft reports, suggest negatives, summarize anomalies, and generate QA checklists. Keep human review on every change that touches bids, budgets, negatives, or campaign status.

### Operator checklist

- Explain the topic in plain English.
- Identify the report, console area, or input data needed.
- Make the smallest safe change first.
- Log the action, reason, and expected review date.
- Escalate if the issue touches policy, inventory, account health, or large budget changes.
